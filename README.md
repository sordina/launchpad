# Conway's [Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) on the Novation Launchpad

A stand-alone Jar package is available in the [downloads](https://github.com/sordina/launchpad/downloads) section.

The Launchpad must be plugged in before starting the app.

## Controls

The center 64 buttons can be pressed to flip the state of a cell.

### Side-Buttons

    'stop'   - Pauses and unpauses the game
    'trk on' - Speeds up the game
    'solo'   - Slows down the game
    'vol'    - Exit the program

## Notes

You will need to install a [driver](http://global.novationmusic.com/support/product-downloads?product=Launchpad#Software)
for the Launchpad in order to be able to use it.

BEWARE...

This is an extremely poorly written program, constructed as a proof of concept and an
excuse to write some Clojure. If you have any feedback about best practices I will be
more than happy to hear it!
